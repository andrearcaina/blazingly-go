# Channels
Channels are a way to group related notes together. They are a way to organize your notes and make it easier to find related notes. It can be created by adding a hashtag to the title of a note. For example, if you have a note about your favorite books, you could add the hashtag #books to the title of the note. This would create a channel called "books" that contains all notes with the hashtag #books in the title.

Go Channels operate on the same principle. They are a way to communicate between goroutines. Channels are used to send and receive data between goroutines. This makes it easier to coordinate the execution of multiple goroutines and share data between them.

A small example is:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new channel
    ch := make(chan int)

    // Send data to the channel
    go func() {
        ch <- 42
    }()

    // Receive data from the channel
    v := <-ch
    fmt.Println(v)
}
```
